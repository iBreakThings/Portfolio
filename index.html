<p>Hello and welcome to Seth Atkinson's Portfolio Page. Here I keep links to various GitHub repositories that I have created as well as my personal resume.</p>

<p>SUMMARY<br>I often find myself searching for new knowledge on subjects that I am interested in, taking my personal time to research and learn more about them. Also, I am strong problem solver, dedicating myself to an issue until I am able to achieve results. I find these skills often coming together to allow me to take on challenges beyond my skillset. I find that the situations in which I am presented with these challenges are the ones where I shine the brightest, and my drive for learning compels me to tackle issues intelligently.
  <br><br>Education<br>Mansfield University of Pennsylvania: 2013 - 2017<br>Bachelor of Science, Computer & Information Science (IS Track), Minor in Accounting, 3.5GPA.
  <br><br>Experience<br>Business Support Services, Mansfield University: April 2014 - December 2015<br>
  While working with the Fixed Asset Manager, I was responsible for keeping track of millions of dollars’ worth of equipment for Mansfield University. I used a database system paired with a physical labeling process to log acquisition, depreciation, and disposal of fixed assets. 
  <br>Campus Technologies, Mansfield University: January 2016 - Present<br>
  As a Technician’s assistant, I would find myself often working with sudden and complex issues with hard and software throughout campus. Also, I was often called upon to preform regular maintenance and inspections of the university’s Point-of-Sale services, including registers, scanners, and the Blackboard PoS system. Often I would be working directly with clients, who were faculty, staff, and students, in assisting them with problems or teaching them how to use various web-based services.
